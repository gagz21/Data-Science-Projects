lPh3NMhUv54,cam lookin fineeee...
lPh3NMhUv54,maybe thier better with cup painting than tattoo
lPh3NMhUv54,I like the boys because the girls were just too basic
lPh3NMhUv54,"They should've given the artists cyan magenta and yellow instead of red blue and yellow. It would create much brighter colors, along with red and blue."
lPh3NMhUv54,Can someone tell me who won!!!
lPh3NMhUv54,THEY SHOULD BRING IN HALO SOMETIME SERIOUSLY!
lPh3NMhUv54,"They chick is a gross, fat box of crayons. I bet she smells"
lPh3NMhUv54,"sees green hair
me: KELLY"
lPh3NMhUv54,Those are NOT primarily colors
lPh3NMhUv54,Laura is alright lookin =)
lPh3NMhUv54,"Am I the only one who thinks they lost a prime opportunity to do a comic book scene or something with all of those dots. lol. Like Superman, y'all."
lPh3NMhUv54,"Omg, I'm painter and in my undergrad I did color theory for 2 years. My professor, always locked the black paint up, and made us use just the primaries (both the warm and cools). Honestly, best thing he could have done. lol, it was annoying at the time though. xD"
lPh3NMhUv54,Talks about color but doesn't even give them the real primary colors. Smh
lPh3NMhUv54,"A lot of people get upset that these challenges have ""nothing to do with tattoos"" but art and composition has everything to do with a good tattoo. A tattoo is a piece of art that is on skin instead of paper. Tattoo artists are artists."
lPh3NMhUv54,oh heck yeah. like perler beads on crack.
lPh3NMhUv54,THOSE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY COLORS I-
lPh3NMhUv54,"The one the girls did looks like cartoonish, it doesn't blend well IMO! That lantern is crazy I like it a lot"
lPh3NMhUv54,"am i the only pissed artist because red blue and yellow, arent primary colours.... its magenta cyan and yellow xD
primary colours are colours you cant make, you make red with magenta and yellow, you make blue with cyan and magenta. pissed lmao"
lPh3NMhUv54,"I thought the real primary colours are cyan magenta and yellow , am i worng ?"

lPh3NMhUv54,"""Are we finger painting?"""
lPh3NMhUv54,Concept-wise I thought the boys were going to knock it out of the park but then I think execution the girls did phenomenal
lPh3NMhUv54,"Ink master's....

FAKE!"
lPh3NMhUv54,Kelly is do demon possessed behind that sweet charade. No telling what she does behind closed doors to achieve that appearance comfortably
lPh3NMhUv54,Does anyone know who won?
lPh3NMhUv54,Kelly looks like Freddy Krueger had a sex change
lPh3NMhUv54,Who won the challenge though??
lPh3NMhUv54,The women's team should definitely win this Flash Challenge
lPh3NMhUv54,I really didn't like either team honestly.
lPh3NMhUv54,"Kelly: fist bumps guy ""dicks first""
Me: did she just-"
lPh3NMhUv54,Does kellys hair become crazier every time she's on the show
lPh3NMhUv54,That orange moth looks like an orange splotch.
lPh3NMhUv54,I feel like Kelly's was way better simply because they went for something challenging and the girls team did something so simple
lPh3NMhUv54,But primary colours are cyan magenta yellow .
lPh3NMhUv54,Who won the challenge ?
lPh3NMhUv54,"Both are reallo cool (and moths (: ), but tI'm more drawn to the mans team one. Curious to see who won on twitter next week (:"
lPh3NMhUv54,Kellys looks like she is cosplaying Beetle juice
lPh3NMhUv54,"Not gonna lie, really don't like the mens team"
lPh3NMhUv54,Fat one looks like she needs a hosing down
lPh3NMhUv54,Bring Nikki Simpson to coach!
