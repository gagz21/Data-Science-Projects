T_Ex77EZFrU,#techguypro
T_Ex77EZFrU,"Nice 
#dtmd"
T_Ex77EZFrU,Coooooooohhhhh
T_Ex77EZFrU,So sad
T_Ex77EZFrU,Dimapur green park
T_Ex77EZFrU,Very good luck
T_Ex77EZFrU,Toup
T_Ex77EZFrU,Good job all up to
T_Ex77EZFrU,"There is no pain when creating tattoos,how long is Tattoo's lifeline?"
T_Ex77EZFrU,"Strongest season ever. Top heavy as fck, but that final 4 is tough!"
T_Ex77EZFrU,Why scar your body even more?
T_Ex77EZFrU,"God bless these ""canvases"" they allow people to tattoo their body if they don't like it it's over"
T_Ex77EZFrU,Breast cancer is no where near the worst
T_Ex77EZFrU,"Do gentleman ever get these sort of tattoos?
:D
It is becoming more popular for ladies... but a lot of men get breast cancer, so I'm curious"
T_Ex77EZFrU,"I just marathonned this season, and the fact that the four of them had all of the tattoos of the day pretty much perfectly sums up why I didn't like this season. There was just such a rift between them and everyone else as far as quality and performance. You knew who the final 3 would be 3 episodes in."
T_Ex77EZFrU,"Its funny how tv land works. Blur out breasts, but only if there is nipple"
T_Ex77EZFrU,3:03 the vulnerability
T_Ex77EZFrU,Cant they tat just nips on em
T_Ex77EZFrU,Sausage looks so nice to work with awe
T_Ex77EZFrU,I want halo to win or sausage
T_Ex77EZFrU,"Man this one made me tear up. My aunt had breast cancer, and I'm happy to still have her."
T_Ex77EZFrU,"this is so sweet aw, all of the women are gorgeous"
T_Ex77EZFrU,tattoo nipples back on
T_Ex77EZFrU,How does sausage keep his hair like that!!!???!??!?
T_Ex77EZFrU,rip scott
T_Ex77EZFrU,To feel feminine and beautiful is so important and I'm really glad these women got the opportunity to feel that way again
T_Ex77EZFrU,Good thing they don't have nipples cause we'd have to sensor that out. Only man nipples are acceptable lol
T_Ex77EZFrU,she ain't got no nipplesssssss
T_Ex77EZFrU,"I think all of the challenges that actually change people's lives (like this one, the one with the canvases that all had some sort of smoking scar, etc) should all be random. If you're the best tattoo artist there you won't have to screw other people over to show that, your tattoo work will show you're the best artist.  This was such a good episode!"
T_Ex77EZFrU,"3:17 censoring guys, you messed up"
T_Ex77EZFrU,Where can I watch the full episodes
T_Ex77EZFrU,"YAY!!!

titties?"
T_Ex77EZFrU,this is my favorite challenge ever
T_Ex77EZFrU,I wish I could see the journey these ladies went on in this episode!!! gah!!!!
T_Ex77EZFrU,why do they censor nipples but not this clearly they are still boobs
T_Ex77EZFrU,Interesting.
T_Ex77EZFrU,"This was an intense, very emotional episode."
T_Ex77EZFrU,Dude where's the rest of the reposted??
T_Ex77EZFrU,"The blonde Mohawk guy, I'm getting green day vibes from him"
T_Ex77EZFrU,Someone knows where can I whatch this in Brazil ?
T_Ex77EZFrU,"I hope sky TV in New Zealand pick up all of Ink Master, we are in Season 3 at the moment and these challenges are amazing.  Hope to see how these tattoos turn out and I hopethese brave women love them."
T_Ex77EZFrU,@Lily Or maybe the men are just better...
T_Ex77EZFrU,"Why are dudes always in the finals? I hate that women on that show are just there to be eye candy, instead of showcasing their talents."
T_Ex77EZFrU,diu
T_Ex77EZFrU,I hope sausage wins!!! He is truly a badass tattoo artist!!
T_Ex77EZFrU,I missed the episode!!! I want to know who won!!!!
T_Ex77EZFrU,I LOVE YOU SAUSAGE! I HOPE YOU WIN!  I'd LOVE to have you do a tat for me someday!! You're GREAT!
