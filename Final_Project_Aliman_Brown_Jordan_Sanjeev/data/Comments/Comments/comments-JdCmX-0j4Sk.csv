JdCmX-0j4Sk,"My thought is that it's the canvas who has to live with the tattoo or pay a lot of money to get it removed so it's well within their rights to get pissed if the tattoo artist screws up. Criticism might piss off the tattoo artist but at the end of the day, who does it affect more in the long term?"
JdCmX-0j4Sk,Dude the woman at 6:05
JdCmX-0j4Sk,"Here some tips for those who want tatoos that tatoo artist will appreciate 
1.sit still while tattooing if you have  hard time tell them it they will lisent but sadly tatoos hurt but if you want it to look good sit still even if it hurts 
2. Lisent to the tatoo arist they have great tips about details about  your tatoo amd body placement (but still get what you want ) domt let them change your mind completely 
3. Go to tatoo artist that does your style or the style you want dont go to some that only does realistic to ask a oldschool tatoo (you know what I mean bye that)"
JdCmX-0j4Sk,It's done well.
JdCmX-0j4Sk,"i remember the spikes one was in the first epsisode i ever watched, oh my goood so frustrating"
JdCmX-0j4Sk,Julia should learn something from Cleen when he had to tattoo that Victorian clown riding a rubber chicken carousel
JdCmX-0j4Sk,I had an issue with a majority of the canvas' except Julia's. That dude was being so patient and respectful and she was getting so triggered by his voice and ideas like that dude is her brother or something. That was the most disrespectful person I've ever seen on this show. Why did she even go and compete if her character is that rude with her clients ????
JdCmX-0j4Sk,he ruin the heart tattoo why put spikes on it thats not what she wanted see the end
JdCmX-0j4Sk,they should add a medical exam for the canvases before they get selected
JdCmX-0j4Sk,The very reason I don't work with the public. People are crazy.
JdCmX-0j4Sk,"That koi fish was honestly pretty nice, should have let the guy finish :/"

JdCmX-0j4Sk,"The first one I kinda understand the canvas's issue. That will be on her forever so she wants it perfect, and I can't blame her"
JdCmX-0j4Sk,That 1st woman acting like she a tattoo artist
JdCmX-0j4Sk,Red haired woman sounded drunk
JdCmX-0j4Sk,How did the coach just randomly offer for the guy to tattoo on him? A tattoo is a huge thing for me lol I'm paranoid about even getting a tiny shape on my ankle

JdCmX-0j4Sk,"Not ganna lie, last girl sounded retarded"
JdCmX-0j4Sk,That canvas was an a-hole...
JdCmX-0j4Sk,It's so scripted it hurts my brain.
JdCmX-0j4Sk,hm....telling someone to go f' themselves is a nature of the holy maker of heaven and earth.....Tornado's exist.
JdCmX-0j4Sk,yo! tf just respect your artist they're only trying to help you.
JdCmX-0j4Sk,At least this is helping me decide who I am not letting do my tattoos
JdCmX-0j4Sk,the the magenta one had a point tho
JdCmX-0j4Sk,"Like I understand if you dont like your tattoo but chill. Respectfully tell them what's wrong and compromise. Sometimes things aren't very easy and things cant be done. Then again at the same time the tattoo artist should also respectful to their client and understand issues and also compromise for the better of the client.

Sorry if my opinion is unpopular... it's just an opinion."
JdCmX-0j4Sk,I really am wondering as to which charm school these people attended ?
JdCmX-0j4Sk,All dem canvas needs some hard slap
