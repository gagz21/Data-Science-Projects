The main data consists of Chicago crime incidents recorded from 2001 to 2017
(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2).

Two different datasets were collected for weather data. The difference between the two is the different areas
in the city they were collected from. The first weather dataset was collected from the City of Chicago website
(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Beach-Weather-Stations-Automated-Sensors/k7hf-8y75).
The Chicago Park District maintains weather sensors at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront.
These sensors generally capture the indicated measurements hourly while the sensors are in operation during the summer.
During other seasons and at some other times, information from the sensors may not be available.

The second weather dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/yochanan/chicago-weather), contributed to kaggle.com from measurements
taken between 2008 and 2015 at Chicago Midway Airport by NOAA (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). This was data which was specifically
curated by a Kaggle.com user for use with the Chicago crimes data (a subset of the data mentioned above)
also available from the same site. It is offered under the Creative Commons license.
