H1tFCSVykwk,That would be hilarious is one of the clients smoked while getting tattooed.
H1tFCSVykwk,That wolf had to have won it. That thing was sick!
H1tFCSVykwk,I understand that guys shooting pain on his knee. Had flashbacks to my own cover-up.
H1tFCSVykwk,If I had to pay for a ratio and the artist would have such attitude... Only that blue hair girl was respectful. I felt sad hearing the judges.
H1tFCSVykwk,Bad idea for an elimination challenge
H1tFCSVykwk,get chris showstoppr on the show please :D
H1tFCSVykwk,"its good to consult with a tattoo artist before doing any work so u know they got your best interest at heart, not some rubbish they want to draw on you.."
H1tFCSVykwk,"I actually just recently got my old self harm scars over my left arm covered up with a tattoo. I have some more tattoos but to get ink in scars hurts like hell. Im not bad with pain tollerance bt this tattoo almost killed me. 

But now I love it more than anything. And I think it personally means so much when you get memories covered up with something so beautiful."
H1tFCSVykwk,yep quitting cigs tomorrow
H1tFCSVykwk,"Damn, give to the guy the tree of life that he wanted"
H1tFCSVykwk,"I do love when amputee's use that in their tattoo designs, I really like those with a little humor in them. Turning something life changing into art, or comedy is the best way to overcome things. I covered up my old cutting scars with a morning glory to represent the promise to my mother never to do it again. (hanakotoba morning glories represent a willful promise)"
H1tFCSVykwk,"Not all of them were being jerks it was nikki Kevin, sketchylawyer, and tito. Kelly and mustache man were nice"
H1tFCSVykwk,i love kelly!
H1tFCSVykwk,The guy who wanted a tree of life that actually meant something made me really sad when the artist took what he wanted and made it some dragon instead
H1tFCSVykwk,I want to be tattooed by Kelly so badly!
H1tFCSVykwk,That was amazing. I think that's the first time I watched something on you tube and it actually made me tear up.
H1tFCSVykwk,Sorry but I have questions. Like why are you timing something that will be on another person's body forever
H1tFCSVykwk,That Dragon the chick did was horrriddd lol
H1tFCSVykwk,Some of them are really disrespectful to the canvases maybe they need to eliminate them if they have bad attitude
H1tFCSVykwk,gian should've won this season smh
H1tFCSVykwk,i want a cigarette now.
H1tFCSVykwk,I am happy they all did so well
H1tFCSVykwk,"Why was everyone so rude? Especially Nikki, at least Kelly was caring and respectful."
H1tFCSVykwk,i would feel bad if the tattoo artist i got assigned were laughing or muttering or cussing i would feel so embarrassed and awful
H1tFCSVykwk,"Dunno if it's just this season but seems like tattoo artist are not really classy.. Groaning and scoffing at client ideas on camera and in front of them, so unprofessional"
H1tFCSVykwk,what's up with that jaw line @ 2:06
H1tFCSVykwk,I feel so bad for the customers. They were in so much pain because the artists were so rushed.
H1tFCSVykwk,That wolf tho
H1tFCSVykwk,"I hate when people look at people, just because of scars, and stuff, like a customer is still a customer, your there to make there dreams true, with a great art piece,"
H1tFCSVykwk,I'm kinda surprised the judges came down so hard on Kelly I actually loved her tattoo and thought it looked great... she also was pretty much the only one(maybe bc of the editing) that was determined to give the best tattoo and help them recover.
H1tFCSVykwk,NO ONE DESERVES CANCER
H1tFCSVykwk,Why get tattooed by guys who don't want to tattoo you AND have to do so under a tight timeline??
H1tFCSVykwk,Y is there not liquor provided for the people getting the tattoos
H1tFCSVykwk,The young dude in red is cute. I hope he's doing better
H1tFCSVykwk,does spike tv even exist anymore? lol
H1tFCSVykwk,"Please keep showing all the finished tats. Even if i dnt see the judgement, its always nice to see the finished product"
H1tFCSVykwk,Hellllllll no. You couldn't pay me enough. I won't even hang out with my friends if they have a cold or pink eye or something.
H1tFCSVykwk,smoking scars? lol dont smoke monkeys
H1tFCSVykwk,The angle of the japanese dragon looks wrong
H1tFCSVykwk,i really don't like Nikki. she has such a short temper and is really rude
H1tFCSVykwk,He convinced him to change it to a dragon because he needed to play safe... what an arsehole
H1tFCSVykwk,Dude with the hole in his neck seems pretty chill
H1tFCSVykwk,Guan Karle is by far one of the best tattoo artist I think he should definitely come back for an all star ink master
H1tFCSVykwk,fking hate her hair
H1tFCSVykwk,"Rude ass tattoo artists like, show some empathy for the poor bastards"
H1tFCSVykwk,No SMOKING or else this will happend to you
H1tFCSVykwk,6:41 yo what the hell did he juss say ? haha
H1tFCSVykwk,I got a scar on my chest . I would love do something like a tattoo. It's straight across on my chest
H1tFCSVykwk,Can tatt2away scars be covered up???
H1tFCSVykwk,The tattooers are kind of a bit rude like they want that its weird or idk
