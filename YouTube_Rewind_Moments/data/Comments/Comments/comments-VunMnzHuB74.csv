VunMnzHuB74,"some of the tattoo work looks better then the judges work,so i don't see how they can criticize these artist"
VunMnzHuB74,That first dude just wanted a free tattoo and then just dipped bruh
VunMnzHuB74,Lmfao a volcano tattoo?
VunMnzHuB74,I am no tattoo expert but. All those tattoo looks amazing.
VunMnzHuB74,Whats with the crack head tweakers getting free tattoos?
VunMnzHuB74,"The outer space battle would be a cool idea if he wasn't such a weirdo with not letting the artist work with the idea and would have compromised some, and if he would have switched the location."
VunMnzHuB74,I feel bad for these artist
VunMnzHuB74,I actually liked the hot air balloon
VunMnzHuB74,"Contestant: draws stickman

Judges: BEAUTIFUL!!! 

Contestant: recreates whole Van Gogh painting perfectly

Judges: What were you thinking with the color palette? Overall this is just bad."
VunMnzHuB74,That volcano tat was really good. Idk what they are talking about
VunMnzHuB74,Does that guy always have a toothpick in his mouth
VunMnzHuB74,The Hispanic dudes stache is like a light year long man lmao
VunMnzHuB74,It would be different in a regular tattoo shop if you wanted something very particular but don't come on TV looking for a special tattoo it's a game show
VunMnzHuB74,Peck is the only qualified judge. Nunez work from what ive seen is worse than some people he judges Wtf!
VunMnzHuB74,"don't these people get free tattoos? Why are they being picky and acting like they just paid these tattoo artists loads of money for it, imagine feeling this entitled smfh"
VunMnzHuB74,"This isn't possible
No I think it is"
VunMnzHuB74,That guy was a dick that hot air balloon was beautiful
VunMnzHuB74,Homeboy wanted the world before he felt that pain on the rib.... rib stomach and neck tattoos separate the men from the boys
VunMnzHuB74,4:13 olivers mustache triggerssssss my ocd
VunMnzHuB74,I love tattoos so definitely I love your program how can I make it to your program to get tattoo
VunMnzHuB74,"I couldn't set and draw out or paint most of these tattoos in 6 hours and I mean no breaks non stop drawing or painting. So the fact these people expect people to actually do these tattoos in that small amount of times yes 6 hours is a long time but in the ""art world"" that is no time!"
VunMnzHuB74,So what happens when u tap out? you just go home with a half done tattoo and leave it on ur body for the rest of ur life?
VunMnzHuB74,I thought his hot air ballon was cute.
VunMnzHuB74,i only have two tattoos. one on the ribs. my tattoo artist warned me and i didn't tap out or anything. i had no idea the stigma attached to it and i'm super proud of my pain tolerance.
VunMnzHuB74,"Um, the goth hippie definitely seems like she says ""rad"" a lot. 
I heard it in my head when i saw that mellow head-nod she did after reading the artist's name."
VunMnzHuB74,I HAVE A FULL RIB TATTOO AND I HABE BOTH RIBS DONE AND DIDNT ACT LIKE THESE FOOLS AND I WAS 18
VunMnzHuB74,Man dont get a big tattoo if you cant handle the pain
VunMnzHuB74,"I want flying saucers going , pew, pew, pew!"
VunMnzHuB74,Am I the only one who thinks the volcano tattoo turned out actually kind of good?
VunMnzHuB74,Mike did an amazing job considering how retarded the client was
VunMnzHuB74,Tattoos are sooo aweful
VunMnzHuB74,"Some of the tattoo artist basically lost because the client wanted bigger or on the ribs even when the tattoo artist would say it wasn't possible(in the time frame) 
This is their job they know what theyâ€™re doing. By saying there wrong and that they can do it is actually proving you wrong! Imagine wanting a tattoo so badly that you end up with trash tattoo that will probably be laughed at"
VunMnzHuB74,The air balloon didn't really look bad...I like it
VunMnzHuB74,5.17 is that jeff from american dad personified?
VunMnzHuB74,"Cant believe how they said the space battle tattoo was not good...like bruh, im not a tattoo pro at all, ofc the planet isnt perfectly round but god damn, the tatt does look awesome..."
VunMnzHuB74,He probably wanted one that big since it's free if your on the show
VunMnzHuB74,Not gonna lie I wouldn't mind any one of those people tattooing me the critics are just looking for anything
VunMnzHuB74,"Why are rib tattoos a big deal when it comes to ink master? My experience getting mine done, I fell asleep..."
VunMnzHuB74,"Dude. Listen to your artist.
I had my ribs done and only did as much as my artist advised."
VunMnzHuB74,Lap band guy is a real jerk - doesn't matter if doesn't fat or not - he sucks.
VunMnzHuB74,These people are being unreasonable
VunMnzHuB74,Some of these clients are just dumb
VunMnzHuB74,none of these look bad at all
VunMnzHuB74,"I have a rib tattoo and it was my first tattoo ever, and I'm pretty skinny. it's really painful but there's no way I'd tap out, especially if the artist needed me. Ribs are known to be painful don't come on a competition and tap out after INSISTING to have it on the ribs"
VunMnzHuB74,This show reaks of deception it upsets me when people don't know how long the tattoo they want will take and even after being told it won't all be possible in 6 hours they still don't budge if it wasn't on a show id turn them away and if I was the client and didn't want to budge I wouldn't let someone uncomfortably do a tattoo he's or she isn't confident in
VunMnzHuB74,It really did look like a chalice of blood with hot air flowing out of it.
VunMnzHuB74,"I don't think as clients,  they understand or are really explained to on what it is that they themselves arent just clients but a actual canvas's for these artists that are expected to execute that task in a timely matter. When your going on a show like this you need to accept an be willing to just say hey ""this is what I want, whatever position you think will work best for you go at it.""  An see what you can come together on, not sit their expecting to be catered to because you would expect to have more say in your average tattoo shop."
VunMnzHuB74,"""HOLY CRAP!"" ~ Sausage"
VunMnzHuB74,How on earth does this show exist...or this challenge specifically. People think us Artist are a circus.
