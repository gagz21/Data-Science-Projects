XQ9l-gwfiRk,0:13 Is it me or did that come off more sexual than it needed to.
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"Also this ""times up, no more ink…"" is so lame and scripted. I haven't seen any tattoos get shutdown like halfway. it's a joke to try to convince us it's an actual competition."
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"I just think calling people canvases is really lame. I know they ALWAYS do it, but it's really just highlighting that these people don't care about their clients. it's about the money - I'll doodle on you then leave my life forever."
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Why do you guys never show the finished tattoo what the hell is the point of watching all this if we can't see the end result lol?
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"the fox was gorgeous , i would have love to see the end result of the octopus also , seems really nice"
XQ9l-gwfiRk,who did the fox tattoo?
XQ9l-gwfiRk,The admittance of being a narcissist was pretty funny
XQ9l-gwfiRk,How can I see how the tattos turned out?!?!
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Blond woman: tattooing and not talking to the canvas suddenly My mom died. She had lung cancer
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Alexis makes me want to beat my dog I can't stand her crying every week. I'm so happy she's gone
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Anybody else find Ash super annoying?
XQ9l-gwfiRk,5:34 that skull is so ugly. The drawing is the easiest part. Wtf

XQ9l-gwfiRk,The fox is hands down one of my favorites
XQ9l-gwfiRk,The fox and that koi were good.
XQ9l-gwfiRk,They should at least show the critics of the judges ! I want to know what the judges say about the tattoos !
XQ9l-gwfiRk,How can I watch full episodes?

XQ9l-gwfiRk,I think so bad this videos that have one frame for one or two seconds!

XQ9l-gwfiRk,TATTOOS ARE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"Oh my oh my! The fox is so amazing!
Damn! Freaking jealous man!"
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Ash is hott
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Everybody Go Through Something Is All About Perseverance
XQ9l-gwfiRk,The fox tattoo is stunning. Brilliant colours.
XQ9l-gwfiRk,I actually want a free handed tattoo.
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Where the heck can I watch this in Australia? Help anyone?
XQ9l-gwfiRk,i think the real challenge would be using more dark skinned people to do tattoos on
XQ9l-gwfiRk,PUT THIS ON NETFLIX OR HULU
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Is it really freehand if they copy another pic
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"Those earrings are ridiculous. How the hell do they not get ripped out? You can see her when she moves her head, she's like a robot haha"
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Lol creepy Jason called my tattoos boring. I have all black and grey.
XQ9l-gwfiRk,who's the blonde
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"If you guys do a Season 13, can you please stop with the lame ass ""theme's?"" ... In this case, man vs woman, I believe recently you had duos of two, and before that Team Peck vs Nunes... Oh yeah and there was Team Christian vs Team Cleen Rock One. And this season, season 12, not only do you have 'gender wars' you also have returning tattooers ""Coaching"" Wow, great way to suggest the level of talent you have, as well as taking the limelight away from the contestants, no... to suggest they need coaches?


The best seasons of Ink Master were the earlier ones where it was a group of individuals or two random teams... No coaching, no themes, no nothing. Just  A tattoo competition. Producers always have to ruin tv shows by getting too hands on. It's tiresome. Can we have one season that puts the spotlight solely on the artists ?! Is that too much to ask?"
XQ9l-gwfiRk,The skull and fox were breathtaking
XQ9l-gwfiRk,1:47 god damn those are some big ass earrings
XQ9l-gwfiRk,I really feel like Ash had a thing for Cam. Am I the only one?
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Judges are on-the-nose douchebags
XQ9l-gwfiRk,God finally. I feel so sorry for all those people ash tattoed. They should get a free tat removal
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"The fox is so gorgeously colored, the lines, the blending, and the flower branch accent just ties it all together! Really well done!"
XQ9l-gwfiRk,need Corey Hart to demo
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Some of the best I've seen.
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Why always there needs to be satanist...
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Love from indonesia...
XQ9l-gwfiRk,Wolves and foxes r similar?? Ummmmmm no..... well they both have teeth and 4 legs and 2 ears lol
XQ9l-gwfiRk,ash deserved to go home a while ago. her tattoos are mediocre and she has a terrible attitude.
XQ9l-gwfiRk,The Fox came out amazing
XQ9l-gwfiRk,"Fox is tha best, so gorgeous"
