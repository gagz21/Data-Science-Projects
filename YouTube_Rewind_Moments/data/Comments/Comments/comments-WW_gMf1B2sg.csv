WW_gMf1B2sg,Damnit ...the last one got me ... damn ninja oninons
WW_gMf1B2sg,"In every challenge like this, the competitors are not competing, they are showing tattooing for humanity."
WW_gMf1B2sg,Is one of them tattooists in the Down syndrome segment now a snake keeper on YouTube
WW_gMf1B2sg,I thought the kids was gon get blasted
WW_gMf1B2sg,The first one. Well he didnâ€™t like it. Lol
WW_gMf1B2sg,"Dave- ""Tom, what's going on bud?""
Tom- ""Brave little kids""
Me- here comes the waterworks for that whole part of the video!
I think I would end up being the guy that gets checked on emotionally on the show."
WW_gMf1B2sg,Damn. Tyler Nolan I didnt expect to be on here I liked him before but his speech about being around people with unconditional love was pretty amazing. Massive respect
WW_gMf1B2sg,"What episode is that last one I know what season ""Battle of The Shops """
WW_gMf1B2sg,I would be so nervous to do any of these tattoos! They are all so meaningful. I just wouldn't want to muck it up.

WW_gMf1B2sg,"I love this video so fricken much. I loved here in each challenge when the artist said ""this is what it's really about"""
WW_gMf1B2sg,Everyone of these had me crying like a baby.  So glad that the artists did what they had to do to make the clients happy and not worry about the competition.
WW_gMf1B2sg,I really want a tattoo of paw prints for my dog with her ashes is it. People tell me I'm weird and it's messed up to do it. So I haven't done it yet
WW_gMf1B2sg,Rlly emotional apart from the last one like y would u want a scar tattoed on you anyone else agree ?
WW_gMf1B2sg,When they say people with Tattoo are bad but what is worse is where  they put theyre mind  into and judge a person a good person. Tattoo is not a bad thing spread this Word plsss
WW_gMf1B2sg,"Okay so why does the lady say ""I wanna get a replica of my grandsons blah blah on side of my head"" but when they show the end results it's a totally different lady and kid? What's up with that?"
