gGe6cs-CdQA,the stick in his mouth the whole time irritates me more than it should
gGe6cs-CdQA,"This was the most stupidest challenge. Judges are criticizing a piece of flesh that reheals itself constantly so of course the tattoo won't stay, and criticizing the tattoo artist for something that was the canvases fault.  don't blame the artist for something out of there control"

gGe6cs-CdQA,The toothpick in the gob is NOT sexy.
gGe6cs-CdQA,how are you going to blame the artist when the canvas is so dumb?
gGe6cs-CdQA,Stressing me out
gGe6cs-CdQA,"I died of laughing when they cut to the guy immediately said ""hell no!!"""
gGe6cs-CdQA,I met. A woman who had her palm her knuckles and the pads of her fingertips tatted. Oh my God. It was messed up.
gGe6cs-CdQA,What's type of paper he's using at min 238?
gGe6cs-CdQA,"If the professional tells you colour is not possible, it is not possible! If the doctor tells you, you need to take the red pill you don't take the vlue -_-"
gGe6cs-CdQA,Tattoos are satans way of making people a property of there own self worship
gGe6cs-CdQA,This was a dumb challenge . They were all set up to fail. Not good tv
gGe6cs-CdQA,Why would a person do this to themselves?  any other body parts exist but why palm?
gGe6cs-CdQA,Stupid canvaces... palm!!!!
gGe6cs-CdQA,"""3d crystal ball""
""Hell nah"""

gGe6cs-CdQA,They can tell us till the cows come home that they won't last but I really wish they would show them 6 months healed
gGe6cs-CdQA,"I perfer a permanent marker, back in high school kids would pay me cause I was a true artist"
gGe6cs-CdQA,WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO SEE WHO WON I'M-
gGe6cs-CdQA,Tbh this episode scared me and gave me anxiety either you end up traumatizing the skin or do it so the tat doesn't hold and once i heard that i said nope nope and nope
gGe6cs-CdQA,"This looks really painful, the tattoo artist are telling you this is a bad idea why would you still want your Palm to be tattooed"
gGe6cs-CdQA,So who won?
gGe6cs-CdQA,If only stupidity hurt- oh wait.
gGe6cs-CdQA,Its not there fault those dumbasses wanted colour
gGe6cs-CdQA,"Canvases: I want a heart done.

Tattooist: yeah Kelly's gonna have to talk her out of it."
gGe6cs-CdQA,That yeti tattoo is so cute! I would want that on any other part of my body except the palm
gGe6cs-CdQA,3:24 what did yellow shirt dude say
gGe6cs-CdQA,"The black dude made me laugh hell nah

But the girl in the red man she look sexy"
gGe6cs-CdQA,I would love to see what these tattoos look like now
gGe6cs-CdQA,I have tattoos pretty much all over my body and I would never ever do the palm....first off the ink is never going to hold correctly so What's the point of going through all that pain for a tattoo that will look awful after a year?
gGe6cs-CdQA,The judges are horrible tattooers I went on their page
gGe6cs-CdQA,It seems inconclusive to say the artist is good or bad when the canvases refuses to take the advice given to them.
gGe6cs-CdQA,Have none of these dumdums ever looked at what a palm tattoo looks like after a while before they decided to do it?
gGe6cs-CdQA,I wonder if boneface and sketchy lawyer know how stupid their names make them look
