the stick in his mouth the whole time irritates me more than it should, VID01
This was the most stupidest challenge. Judges are criticizing a piece of flesh that reheals itself constantly so of course the tattoo won't stay  and criticizing the tattoo artist for something that was the canvases fault.  don't blame the artist for something out of there control, VID01
THAT LION FISH WAS TRASH LOLOLOL, VID01
Hell nah, VID01
i thought he was going to say ribs-, VID01
The editing of the show is hilarious 6:39 bam boom click FLASH *whirls around to face the speaker, VID01
The toothpick in the gob is NOT sexy., VID01
how are you going to blame the artist when the canvas is so dumb?, VID01
Stressing me out, VID01
I died of laughing when they cut to the guy immediately said 'hell no!!', VID01
I met. A woman who had her palm her knuckles and the pads of her fingertips tatted. Oh my God. It was messed up., VID01
What's type of paper he's using at min 238?, VID01
If the professional tells you colour is not possible  it is not possible! If the doctor tells you  you need to take the red pill you don't take the vlue -_-, VID01
Tattoos are satans way of making people a property of there own self worship, VID01
This was a dumb challenge . They were all set up to fail. Not good tv, VID01
Why would a person do this to themselves?  any other body parts exist but why palm?, VID01
Stupid canvaces... palm!!!!, VID01
3d crystal ball' 'Hell nah', VID01
Hell nah, VID01
I didn't know that was Kevin from when he was on black ink crew, VID01
This is literally chopped but with tats, VID01
feminist girl detected, VID01
I didn't know that was Dave HEY DAVE, VID01
Thank god it's not aged for a long time, VID01
I love Kelly's one the most.., VID01
Ryan ashley  step on me, VID01
They can tell us till the cows come home that they won't last but I really wish they would show them 6 months healed, VID01
I perfer a permanent marker  back in high school kids would pay me cause I was a true artist, VID01
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO SEE WHO WON I'M-, VID01
Tbh this episode scared me and gave me anxiety either you end up traumatizing the skin or do it so the tat doesn't hold and once i heard that i said nope nope and nope, VID01
This looks really painful  the tattoo artist are telling you this is a bad idea why would you still want your Palm to be tattooed, VID01
So who won?, VID01
If only stupidity hurt- oh wait., VID01
Its not there fault those dumbasses wanted colour, VID01
Canvases: I want a heart done. Tattooist: yeah Kelly's gonna have to talk her out of it., VID01
That yeti tattoo is so cute! I would want that on any other part of my body except the palm, VID01
3:24 what did yellow shirt dude say, VID01
The black dude made me laugh hell nah But the girl in the red man she look sexy, VID01
I would love to see what these tattoos look like now, VID01
I have tattoos pretty much all over my body and I would never ever do the palm....first off the ink is never going to hold correctly so What's the point of going through all that pain for a tattoo that will look awful after a year?, VID01
The judges are horrible tattooers I went on their page, VID01
It seems inconclusive to say the artist is good or bad when the canvases refuses to take the advice given to them., VID01
Have none of these dumdums ever looked at what a palm tattoo looks like after a while before they decided to do it?, VID01
I wonder if boneface and sketchy lawyer know how stupid their names make them look, VID01
Where can i stream full episodes for free?, VID01
Inkmaster is irl total drama island, VID01
Once you watch one of these you can't stop, VID01
Hell nawl!, VID01
0:43 Valerio wants to know your location, VID01
Took me 5 years to watch this.. why didn't I watch this then, VID01
That would be hilarious is one of the clients smoked while getting tattooed., VID02
That wolf had to have won it. That thing was sick!, VID02
I understand that guys shooting pain on his knee. Had flashbacks to my own cover-up., VID02
If I had to pay for a ratio and the artist would have such attitude... Only that blue hair girl was respectful. I felt sad hearing the judges., VID02
Bad idea for an elimination challenge, VID02
get chris showstoppr on the show please :D, VID02
its good to consult with a tattoo artist before doing any work so u know they got your best interest at heart  not some rubbish they want to draw on you.., VID02
I actually just recently got my old self harm scars over my left arm covered up with a tattoo. I have some more tattoos but to get ink in scars hurts like hell. Im not bad with pain tollerance bt this tattoo almost killed me. But now I love it more than anything. And I think it personally means so much when you get memories covered up with something so beautiful., VID02
yep quitting cigs tomorrow, VID02
Damn  give to the guy the tree of life that he wanted, VID02
I do love when amputee's use that in their tattoo designs  I really like those with a little humor in them. Turning something life changing into art  or comedy is the best way to overcome things. I covered up my old cutting scars with a morning glory to represent the promise to my mother never to do it again. (hanakotoba morning glories represent a willful promise), VID02
Not all of them were being jerks it was nikki Kevin  sketchylawyer  and tito. Kelly and mustache man were nice, VID02
i love kelly!, VID02
The guy who wanted a tree of life that actually meant something made me really sad when the artist took what he wanted and made it some dragon instead, VID02
I want to be tattooed by Kelly so badly!, VID02
That was amazing. I think that's the first time I watched something on you tube and it actually made me tear up., VID02
Sorry but I have questions. Like why are you timing something that will be on another person's body forever, VID02
That Dragon the chick did was horrriddd lol, VID02
Some of them are really disrespectful to the canvases maybe they need to eliminate them if they have bad attitude, VID02
gian should've won this season smh, VID02
i want a cigarette now., VID02
I am happy they all did so well, VID02
Why was everyone so rude? Especially Nikki  at least Kelly was caring and respectful., VID02
i would feel bad if the tattoo artist i got assigned were laughing or muttering or cussing i would feel so embarrassed and awful, VID02
Dunno if it's just this season but seems like tattoo artist are not really classy.. Groaning and scoffing at client ideas on camera and in front of them  so unprofessional, VID02
what's up with that jaw line @ 2:06, VID02
I feel so bad for the customers. They were in so much pain because the artists were so rushed., VID02
That wolf tho, VID02
I hate when people look at people  just because of scars  and stuff  like a customer is still a customer  your there to make there dreams true  with a great art piece , VID02
I'm kinda surprised the judges came down so hard on Kelly I actually loved her tattoo and thought it looked great... she also was pretty much the only one(maybe bc of the editing) that was determined to give the best tattoo and help them recover., VID02
NO ONE DESERVES CANCER, VID02
Why get tattooed by guys who don't want to tattoo you AND have to do so under a tight timeline??, VID02
Y is there not liquor provided for the people getting the tattoos, VID02
The young dude in red is cute. I hope he's doing better, VID02
does spike tv even exist anymore? lol, VID02
Please keep showing all the finished tats. Even if i dnt see the judgement  its always nice to see the finished product, VID02
Hellllllll no. You couldn't pay me enough. I won't even hang out with my friends if they have a cold or pink eye or something., VID02
smoking scars? lol dont smoke monkeys, VID02
The angle of the japanese dragon looks wrong, VID02
i really don't like Nikki. she has such a short temper and is really rude, VID02
He convinced him to change it to a dragon because he needed to play safe... what an arsehole, VID02
Dude with the hole in his neck seems pretty chill, VID02
Guan Karle is by far one of the best tattoo artist I think he should definitely come back for an all star ink master, VID02
fking hate her hair, VID02
Rude ass tattoo artists like  show some empathy for the poor bastards, VID02
No SMOKING or else this will happend to you, VID02
6:41 yo what the hell did he juss say ? haha, VID02
I got a scar on my chest . I would love do something like a tattoo. It's straight across on my chest, VID02
Can tatt2away scars be covered up???, VID02
The tattooers are kind of a bit rude like they want that its weird or idk, VID02
My thought is that it's the canvas who has to live with the tattoo or pay a lot of money to get it removed so it's well within their rights to get pissed if the tattoo artist screws up. Criticism might piss off the tattoo artist but at the end of the day  who does it affect more in the long term?, VID03
Dude the woman at 6:05, VID03
Here some tips for those who want tatoos that tatoo artist will appreciate 1.sit still while tattooing if you have  hard time tell them it they will lisent but sadly tatoos hurt but if you want it to look good sit still even if it hurts 2. Lisent to the tatoo arist they have great tips about details about  your tatoo amd body placement (but still get what you want ) domt let them change your mind completely 3. Go to tatoo artist that does your style or the style you want dont go to some that only does realistic to ask a oldschool tatoo (you know what I mean bye that), VID03
It's done well., VID03
i remember the spikes one was in the first epsisode i ever watched  oh my goood so frustrating, VID03
Julia should learn something from Cleen when he had to tattoo that Victorian clown riding a rubber chicken carousel, VID03
I had an issue with a majority of the canvas' except Julia's. That dude was being so patient and respectful and she was getting so triggered by his voice and ideas like that dude is her brother or something. That was the most disrespectful person I've ever seen on this show. Why did she even go and compete if her character is that rude with her clients ????, VID03
he ruin the heart tattoo why put spikes on it thats not what she wanted see the end, VID03
they should add a medical exam for the canvases before they get selected, VID03
The very reason I don't work with the public. People are crazy., VID03
That koi fish was honestly pretty nice  should have let the guy finish :/, VID03
Wow 1:55 why he say no like he's three man this dude is like rick James (never rubbed feet on his couch...3 seconds later ya I rememebr  rubbin my feet in his couch)44 he told dude we need to do black and grey he said that's fine..then 2:00 he says no wtf, VID03
That chick just wanted to show off her tits, VID03
That girl has personality disorder jeez, VID03
Rookie tattoo artist, VID03
Because I'm getting my first tattoo on the 28th for my 18th birthday I have been watching ink master a lot, VID03
Id murder that litsa girl tbh, VID03
The first one I kinda understand the canvas's issue. That will be on her forever so she wants it perfect  and I can't blame her, VID03
That 1st woman acting like she a tattoo artist, VID03
Red haired woman sounded drunk, VID03
How did the coach just randomly offer for the guy to tattoo on him? A tattoo is a huge thing for me lol I'm paranoid about even getting a tiny shape on my ankle, VID03
7:00 You liar, VID03
Canvas being picky?? Well yeah it's a tattoo..., VID03
Mikes a dick Never Never piss off a human being with a Tat gun in their hand.  I visited this shop in Germany this dude pissed off the owner He got stabbed in the eye. I nearly puked, VID03
Not ganna lie  last girl sounded retarded, VID03
That canvas was an a-hole..., VID03
It's so scripted it hurts my brain., VID03
hm....telling someone to go f' themselves is a nature of the holy maker of heaven and earth.....Tornado's exist., VID03
yo! tf just respect your artist they're only trying to help you., VID03
At least this is helping me decide who I am not letting do my tattoos, VID03
the the magenta one had a point tho, VID03
Like I understand if you dont like your tattoo but chill. Respectfully tell them what's wrong and compromise. Sometimes things aren't very easy and things cant be done. Then again at the same time the tattoo artist should also respectful to their client and understand issues and also compromise for the better of the client. Sorry if my opinion is unpopular... it's just an opinion., VID03
I really am wondering as to which charm school these people attended ?, VID03
All dem canvas needs some hard slap, VID03
7:15 the face when karma bites back, VID03
lmfao bruh the way he said 'that's a water splashhh' at 3:21 i lowkey felt bad for him, VID03
her name is litsa clearly she was gonna be crazy, VID03
Man Anthony was the coolest cat to ever go on that show, VID03
The last girl had to of been high or drunk. She was absolutely crazy, VID03
I love that they gave Julia the opportunity to dig her own grave before revealing they saw everything lmao, VID03
The girl with the koi fish needed a eye exam cuz that tattoo was beautiful and her boobs need to go down a few sizes., VID03
5:20.   Dude is huge, VID03
3:08 just realized that's a pornstar lol, VID03
lol, VID03
Julia is crazy as hell, VID03
Oooo I would have the worst attitude if I was a tattoo artist, VID03
That first one is crazy. It's a free tattoo lol, VID03
I'm way too shy to tell a artist I don't like a tattoo :*, VID03
The lady with the Koi tattoo is a pornstar named Mary Jean.......for science reasons, VID03
Thanks God I had a pretty good talented  Hungarian tattoo artist . ., VID03
cam lookin fineeee..., VID04
maybe thier better with cup painting than tattoo, VID04
I like the boys because the girls were just too basic, VID04
They should've given the artists cyan magenta and yellow instead of red blue and yellow. It would create much brighter colors  along with red and blue., VID04
Can someone tell me who won!!!, VID04
THEY SHOULD BRING IN HALO SOMETIME SERIOUSLY!, VID04
They chick is a gross  fat box of crayons. I bet she smells, VID04
sees green hair me: KELLY, VID04
Those are NOT primarily colors, VID04
Laura is alright lookin =), VID04
Am I the only one who thinks they lost a prime opportunity to do a comic book scene or something with all of those dots. lol. Like Superman  y'all., VID04
Omg  I'm painter and in my undergrad I did color theory for 2 years. My professor  always locked the black paint up  and made us use just the primaries (both the warm and cools). Honestly  best thing he could have done. lol  it was annoying at the time though. xD, VID04
Talks about color but doesn't even give them the real primary colors. Smh, VID04
A lot of people get upset that these challenges have 'nothing to do with tattoos' but art and composition has everything to do with a good tattoo. A tattoo is a piece of art that is on skin instead of paper. Tattoo artists are artists., VID04
oh heck yeah. like perler beads on crack., VID04
THOSE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY COLORS I-, VID04
The one the girls did looks like cartoonish  it doesn't blend well IMO! That lantern is crazy I like it a lot, VID04
"am i the only pissed artist because red blue and yellow  arent primary colours.... its magenta cyan and yellow xD
primary colours are colours you cant make  you make red with magenta and yellow  you make blue with cyan and magenta. pissed lmao", VID04
I thought the real primary colours are cyan magenta and yellow   am i worng ?, VID04
That latern is sooooo neat looking!, VID04
Does anybody know who won?, VID04
0:41 wtf she wearin ugly asf, VID04
The men won to me, VID04
Are we finger painting?', VID04
Concept-wise I thought the boys were going to knock it out of the park but then I think execution the girls did phenomenal, VID04
Ink master's.... FAKE!, VID04
Kelly is do demon possessed behind that sweet charade. No telling what she does behind closed doors to achieve that appearance comfortably, VID04
Does anyone know who won?, VID04
Kelly looks like Freddy Krueger had a sex change, VID04
Who won the challenge though??, VID04
The women's team should definitely win this Flash Challenge, VID04
I really didn't like either team honestly., VID04
Kelly: fist bumps guy 'dicks first' Me: did she just-, VID04
Does kellys hair become crazier every time she's on the show, VID04
That orange moth looks like an orange splotch., VID04
I feel like Kelly's was way better simply because they went for something challenging and the girls team did something so simple, VID04
But primary colours are cyan magenta yellow ., VID04
Who won the challenge ?, VID04
Both are reallo cool (and moths (: )  but tI'm more drawn to the mans team one. Curious to see who won on twitter next week (:, VID04
Kellys looks like she is cosplaying Beetle juice, VID04
Not gonna lie  really don't like the mens team, VID04
Fat one looks like she needs a hosing down, VID04
Bring Nikki Simpson to coach!, VID04
I think kelly is adorable c:, VID04
God damn Cam is so fine he can permanently implant me his child instead of that ink THATS for sure, VID04
How did they stand the pictures up? Are there cap tops?, VID04
"Nunez: I wanna look at something and know what it is
Also Nunez: toDaY yOu MuSt UsE iNvIsIbLE pAiNt", VID04
what a waste of iiiiinnnnkkkk. jfc., VID04
My two faves!, VID04
Kelly is the sweetest, VID04
Judges: make a sculptor out of toothpicks. Artists: why? Judges: Because it will look CoOl Artists: ... k, VID05
Why do tattooist need to paint in a giant container with pressure water..... Same with these toothpick.... Are these really tattooist and not art students with fake tattoo on their skin for special effect...., VID05
Her lips disturb me., VID05
tHaTs nOt a cHalLeNgE i wOulD piCk, VID05
Creepy whatever his name is  is wearing a Freemason Ring, VID05
Any chance you could start showing who actually wins the challenge on these YouTube vids please??????, VID05
what is her name? that short hair im mean, VID05
When the pun was said and no one laughed  I love how they jumped to the image of him dying inside, VID05
Sooooo... who won?, VID05
YOU SOOOOOO SMAAAAART, VID05
Guys team sculpture luks cringy af lol, VID05
Remind me please  how exactly does this reflect who TATTOO'S the best?, VID05
Megan grabbed these men by the balls! Love her mentality, VID05
Nothing says tattooing like tooth pick sculptures., VID05
this is why im not an artist  i wouldve done a house lol, VID05
Can someone tell me who won?, VID05
So let me get this straight They're building trees out of what was once trees, VID05
Mr. Beast  job well done. Even Ink Master is doing it  now, VID05
sees Freemason ring 'Illuminati!!' Lol, VID05
Why does someone always go: 'Niiice' when he repeats the prizes? It's not like it's news., VID05
The blossom tree was so pretty, VID05
that pun was great and nobody acknowledge it, VID05
isn't this a tattoo show, VID05
And what does this have to do with tattooing, VID05
Let me get this straight  in order to become a master in Tattooing i need to build stuff out of toothpicks?, VID05
That one girl looks like Bhad Bhabie, VID05
Who won the challenge???, VID05
I think the idea of a suspension bridge would of looked good made with the tooth picks!, VID05
I had to do the egg drop thing back in HS  but we could only use toothpicks and hot glue.  This reminds me of that. Note: I do t remember how it related to physics or how any of it was applied., VID05
1:19 what' her name?, VID05
Damn everyones white and free masons, VID05
4:28 he sounds like every kindhearted wizard/witch/warlock/gnome from fantastical fairy tale movies. Looks like one too  a jolly one., VID05
Bring back gian Pleaseeeeeee, VID05
A team is only as strong as its leader or only as strong as their weakest member?, VID05
This one is not even close. Girls team by a landslide., VID05
12 years wow long time, VID05
I didn't know Bhad Bhabie was on ink master... (0:24), VID05
there will be a female winner  the season was set up specifically to find one., VID05
I didnt know danielle bregoli was on ink masters, VID05
Ugh. Megan., VID05
I wanna see how this would turn out if team DJ does this challenge., VID05
At first I thought pon was gion  and he just gained some weight... I'm still not quite sure..., VID05
I would've made a porcupine, VID05
Megan Jean just looks like my female GTA character that went straight out of the game lol love her tho!, VID05
Thought they said James Bond, VID05
Oliver for sure is taking home any unused toothpicks. Perhaps to make a frame for his picture of his ex-wife...Kat Von D, VID05
So  no one is going to mention the Freemason ring ?, VID05
Why is it always cool for women to use sexism on men  but not the other way around?, VID05
Hahaha i loveeee it... Oooh lord have mercy :D love how james says this line, VID05
I think the girls team win this time. All the guys did was make a pathway  glue sticks in a ball  and made a spiral. The girl made a while bunch of different sections that they had to strategically place in order to make the flow of the tree. Loved the girls, VID05
awesome video, VID06
K, VID06
#techguypro, VID06
Nice #dtmd, VID06
Coooooooohhhhh, VID06
So sad, VID06
Dimapur green park, VID06
Very good luck, VID06
Toup, VID06
Good job all up to, VID06
There is no pain when creating tattoos how long is Tattoo's lifeline?, VID06
Strongest season ever. Top heavy as fck  but that final 4 is tough!, VID06
Why scar your body even more?, VID06
God bless these 'canvases' they allow people to tattoo their body if they don't like it it's over, VID06
Breast cancer is no where near the worst, VID06
Do gentleman ever get these sort of tattoos? :D It is becoming more popular for ladies... but a lot of men get breast cancer  so I'm curious, VID06
I just marathonned this season  and the fact that the four of them had all of the tattoos of the day pretty much perfectly sums up why I didn't like this season. There was just such a rift between them and everyone else as far as quality and performance. You knew who the final 3 would be 3 episodes in., VID06
Its funny how tv land works. Blur out breasts  but only if there is nipple, VID06
3:03 the vulnerability, VID06
Cant they tat just nips on em, VID06
Sausage looks so nice to work with awe, VID06
I want halo to win or sausage, VID06
Man this one made me tear up. My aunt had breast cancer  and I'm happy to still have her., VID06
this is so sweet aw  all of the women are gorgeous, VID06
tattoo nipples back on, VID06
How does sausage keep his hair like that!!!???!??!?, VID06
rip scott, VID06
To feel feminine and beautiful is so important and I'm really glad these women got the opportunity to feel that way again, VID06
Good thing they don't have nipples cause we'd have to sensor that out. Only man nipples are acceptable lol, VID06
she ain't got no nipplesssssss, VID06
I think all of the challenges that actually change people's lives (like this one  the one with the canvases that all had some sort of smoking scar  etc) should all be random. If you're the best tattoo artist there you won't have to screw other people over to show that  your tattoo work will show you're the best artist.  This was such a good episode!, VID06
3:17 censoring guys  you messed up, VID06
Where can I watch the full episodes, VID06
YAY!!! titties?, VID06
this is my favorite challenge ever, VID06
I wish I could see the journey these ladies went on in this episode!!! gah!!!!, VID06
why do they censor nipples but not this clearly they are still boobs, VID06
Interesting., VID06
This was an intense  very emotional episode., VID06
Dude where's the rest of the reposted??, VID06
The blonde Mohawk guy  I'm getting green day vibes from him, VID06
Someone knows where can I whatch this in Brazil ?, VID06
I hope sky TV in New Zealand pick up all of Ink Master  we are in Season 3 at the moment and these challenges are amazing.¬† Hope to see how these tattoos turn out and I hopethese brave women love them., VID06
@Lily Or maybe the men are just better..., VID06
Why are dudes always in the finals? I hate that women on that show are just there to be eye candy  instead of showcasing their talents., VID06
diu, VID06
I hope sausage wins!!! He is truly a badass tattoo artist!!, VID06
I missed the episode!!! I want to know who won!!!!, VID06
I LOVE YOU SAUSAGE! I HOPE YOU WIN!¬† I'd LOVE to have you do a tat for me someday!! You're GREAT!, VID06
I hop they could do great, VID06
Who volunteers for this shiz?????? Idk that it's free. Especially the blank canvases like wtf, VID07
Clap, VID07
I hope this dude can handle 2 dudes at once man' i know what your thinking, VID07
6:56. Awe Anthony is so sweet, VID07
I really wish they would show m ore of the finished tatts. it is so annoying, VID07
Morale of the story..THREESOME IS INTENSE..and painful, VID07
4:34 woah  wording, VID07
I can handle two dudes at once LOL, VID07
6:56 the fact that Anthony is holding her hand. ughhhh  this man <3, VID07
I hate when they cut these short! I wanted to see the judge's reactions and a better close up of finished product WTF, VID07
Dave has no right to be a judge he knows nothing about tattooing, VID07
I HATE CLEAN or whatever his name is.., VID07
Two dudes at once!!!!, VID07
I'm surprised Jesse didn't do a googly eyes and teeth wing, VID07
James Vaughn entertains me to no end., VID07
I hope this dude can handle two dudes at once man', VID07
3:30 when you hope to get you're homie in a team activity and actually get him, VID07
I get artists wanna be pair with people they are comfortable with but isn‚Äôt the point of being a good artist  being able to work with just about ANYONE? , VID07
4:33  XD hahaha nice, VID07
I hope this dude can handle two dudes at once man', VID07
Why do never show the completed tattoos or who won the challenge?, VID07
whoooaaa ..., VID07
The big guys was amazing, VID07
The subject has the biggest challenge, VID07
Wew, VID07
Real artist have fear, VID07
1 person doing the tatoo is hell but 2 now that's just absolute misery, VID07
Hi, VID07
the host had a top tat ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, VID07
This is so sexual 'I don't know if he can take two guys' 'I'm gonna finish', VID07
I actually find it sweet that Anthony held the girl's hand @6:56 while his team coach her thru the pain! Nice guys.... I need more INK MASTERRRRRR, VID07
The smaller wings with more attention to detail is a much safer bet and the canvas is always more comfortable because you can afford to take breaks. I don't know why these fools are always doing these massive tattoos., VID07
9:13 damn  that chick's not covering up, VID07
Who won??, VID07
Basically  everyone was happy with their teammate EXCEPT Sausage and Jesse, VID07
If youre in a room with 2 other people who want the same tattoo.. you're getting the wrong tattoo., VID07
wait so did the volunteers actually see the design and how big it is or what, VID07
0:18 on his neck is leviathan cross, VID07
Jessie mhhhhhhhhh, VID07
I work next to Jesse at his tattoo shop called loose screw he is an amazing person and always gives me free stuff lol, VID07
Nice tattoo, VID07
What a whore, VID07
I need for my leg ...., VID07
What kinda name is sausage, VID07
The part your looking for is. 6:08, VID07
are these permanent or temporary, VID07
I'm Lucifer bloody Morningstar', VID07
I'll be a canvas!!!, VID07
We're can I watch this? I'm European so.., VID07
Malia, VID07
some of the tattoo work looks better then the judges work so i don't see how they can criticize these artist, VID08
That first dude just wanted a free tattoo and then just dipped bruh, VID08
Lmfao a volcano tattoo?, VID08
I am no tattoo expert but. All those tattoo looks amazing., VID08
Whats with the crack head tweakers getting free tattoos?, VID08
The outer space battle would be a cool idea if he wasn't such a weirdo with not letting the artist work with the idea and would have compromised some  and if he would have switched the location., VID08
I feel bad for these artist, VID08
I actually liked the hot air balloon, VID08
Contestant: draws stickman Judges: BEAUTIFUL!!! Contestant: recreates whole Van Gogh painting perfectly Judges: What were you thinking with the color palette? Overall this is just bad., VID08
That volcano tat was really good. Idk what they are talking about, VID08
Does that guy always have a toothpick in his mouth, VID08
The Hispanic dudes stache is like a light year long man lmao, VID08
It would be different in a regular tattoo shop if you wanted something very particular but don't come on TV looking for a special tattoo it's a game show, VID08
Peck is the only qualified judge. Nunez work from what ive seen is worse than some people he judges Wtf!, VID08
don't these people get free tattoos? Why are they being picky and acting like they just paid these tattoo artists loads of money for it  imagine feeling this entitled smfh, VID08
This isn't possible No I think it is, VID08
That guy was a dick that hot air balloon was beautiful, VID08
Homeboy wanted the world before he felt that pain on the rib.... rib stomach and neck tattoos separate the men from the boys, VID08
4:13 olivers mustache triggerssssss my ocd, VID08
I love tattoos so definitely I love your program how can I make it to your program to get tattoo, VID08
I couldn't set and draw out or paint most of these tattoos in 6 hours and I mean no breaks non stop drawing or painting. So the fact these people expect people to actually do these tattoos in that small amount of times yes 6 hours is a long time but in the 'art world' that is no time!, VID08
So what happens when u tap out? you just go home with a half done tattoo and leave it on ur body for the rest of ur life?, VID08
I thought his hot air ballon was cute., VID08
i only have two tattoos. one on the ribs. my tattoo artist warned me and i didn't tap out or anything. i had no idea the stigma attached to it and i'm super proud of my pain tolerance., VID08
"Um  the goth hippie definitely seems like she says 'rad' a lot. 
I heard it in my head when i saw that mellow head-nod she did after reading the artist's name.", VID08
I HAVE A FULL RIB TATTOO AND I HABE BOTH RIBS DONE AND DIDNT ACT LIKE THESE FOOLS AND I WAS 18, VID08
Man dont get a big tattoo if you cant handle the pain, VID08
I want flying saucers going   pew  pew  pew!, VID08
Am I the only one who thinks the volcano tattoo turned out actually kind of good?, VID08
Mike did an amazing job considering how retarded the client was, VID08
Tattoos are sooo aweful, VID08
Some of the tattoo artist basically lost because the client wanted bigger or on the ribs even when the tattoo artist would say it wasn't possible(in the time frame) This is their job they know what they‚Äôre doing. By saying there wrong and that they can do it is actually proving you wrong! Imagine wanting a tattoo so badly that you end up with trash tattoo that will probably be laughed at, VID08
The air balloon didn't really look bad...I like it, VID08
5.17 is that jeff from american dad personified?, VID08
Cant believe how they said the space battle tattoo was not good...like bruh  im not a tattoo pro at all  ofc the planet isnt perfectly round but god damn  the tatt does look awesome..., VID08
He probably wanted one that big since it's free if your on the show, VID08
Not gonna lie I wouldn't mind any one of those people tattooing me the critics are just looking for anything, VID08
Why are rib tattoos a big deal when it comes to ink master? My experience getting mine done  I fell asleep..., VID08
Dude. Listen to your artist. I had my ribs done and only did as much as my artist advised., VID08
Lap band guy is a real jerk - doesn't matter if doesn't fat or not - he sucks., VID08
These people are being unreasonable, VID08
Some of these clients are just dumb, VID08
none of these look bad at all, VID08
I have a rib tattoo and it was my first tattoo ever  and I'm pretty skinny. it's really painful but there's no way I'd tap out  especially if the artist needed me. Ribs are known to be painful don't come on a competition and tap out after INSISTING to have it on the ribs, VID08
This show reaks of deception it upsets me when people don't know how long the tattoo they want will take and even after being told it won't all be possible in 6 hours they still don't budge if it wasn't on a show id turn them away and if I was the client and didn't want to budge I wouldn't let someone uncomfortably do a tattoo he's or she isn't confident in, VID08
It really did look like a chalice of blood with hot air flowing out of it., VID08
I don't think as clients   they understand or are really explained to on what it is that they themselves arent just clients but a actual canvas's for these artists that are expected to execute that task in a timely matter. When your going on a show like this you need to accept an be willing to just say hey 'this is what I want  whatever position you think will work best for you go at it.'  An see what you can come together on  not sit their expecting to be catered to because you would expect to have more say in your average tattoo shop., VID08
HOLY CRAP!' ~ Sausage, VID08
How on earth does this show exist...or this challenge specifically. People think us Artist are a circus., VID08
Dr.Phil could be  good tattoo artist listening customers problems  while destroying their life., VID08
I'm crying and I don't even watch this show., VID09
Hate the guy with stick in his mouth, VID09
I really wish they would have showed these tattoos. they were all so meaningful., VID09
Ok.....the parent of the soldier killed in action (aka murdered in action) who gave the dog tag to the tattooist.... The downs syndrome tattoos..... And the kids... I blubbed like hell.. Excellent work guys and gals..., VID09
Tom whats going on buddy Brave little kids awws my heart, VID09
Awwww im sitting here trying not to cry, VID09
Damnit ...the last one got me ... damn ninja oninons, VID09
In every challenge like this  the competitors are not competing  they are showing tattooing for humanity., VID09
Is one of them tattooists in the Down syndrome segment now a snake keeper on YouTube, VID09
I thought the kids was gon get blasted, VID09
The first one. Well he didn‚Äôt like it. Lol, VID09
Dave- 'Tom  what's going on bud?' Tom- 'Brave little kids' Me- here comes the waterworks for that whole part of the video! I think I would end up being the guy that gets checked on emotionally on the show., VID09
Damn. Tyler Nolan I didnt expect to be on here I liked him before but his speech about being around people with unconditional love was pretty amazing. Massive respect, VID09
What episode is that last one I know what season 'Battle of The Shops ', VID09
I would be so nervous to do any of these tattoos! They are all so meaningful. I just wouldn't want to muck it up., VID09
Tearjerker alert!!!! More please., VID09
Great episode super accessible and touching, VID09
11:50  SOMEONE HELP ME that song???, VID09
I'm not crying you are...., VID09
I did chemo  so I can do this.' BADASS WOMAN RIGHT THERE!, VID09
Props to those women for dealing with the pain so well!, VID09
I'm disappointed i couldn't see the rest of the tattoos cause you cut the edit too short my man. :(, VID09
5:44 what made me cry  cuz it was beautiful! amazing art work!!! im so happy for her, VID09
Oh gosh... this made me cry too., VID09
I love this video so fricken much. I loved here in each challenge when the artist said 'this is what it's really about', VID09
Everyone of these had me crying like a baby.  So glad that the artists did what they had to do to make the clients happy and not worry about the competition., VID09
I really want a tattoo of paw prints for my dog with her ashes is it. People tell me I'm weird and it's messed up to do it. So I haven't done it yet, VID09
Rlly emotional apart from the last one like y would u want a scar tattoed on you anyone else agree ?, VID09
When they say people with Tattoo are bad but what is worse is where  they put theyre mind  into and judge a person a good person. Tattoo is not a bad thing spread this Word plsss, VID09
Okay so why does the lady say 'I wanna get a replica of my grandsons blah blah on side of my head' but when they show the end results it's a totally different lady and kid? What's up with that?, VID09
Kinda stuff that gives you that warm fuzzy feeling and a tear in the eye, VID09
I'm absolutely bawling, VID09
dad af, VID09
U just have to give props to everyone, VID09
10:53 'Brave little kids' made me just break down in tears, VID09
I have diabetes and a pump like the diabetic I'm telling my mom that she should get it done, VID09
The intro thumbnail looks like a Mumford and Suns cover band from 2087, VID09
I'm not crying... you're crying, VID09
My son is obese so i want a bag of potato chips tattooed on my stomach, VID09
I wish one day @Ink Master invited me to tatto my body full back body. cause that was my dream. but i dont have enough money to, VID09
Okaaay i'll just cry for 13 minutes thanks., VID09
I'm crying, VID09
O my.. my eyes are sweating, VID09
Um... might be wrong show but.... Corey Taylor?, VID09
My respects brave kids awesome job my son is 3 years old was born with autism got me In tears, VID09
Damm the 1st one ..hit me hard..brought tears to my eyes..R.I.P TO ALL THE FALLEN ANGELS.., VID09
Are they on the midway???!!??, VID09
I did chemo  I can do this' made my heart shutter, VID09
That's sweet ;-;, VID09
ah good  we're all crying together., VID09
0:13 Is it me or did that come off more sexual than it needed to., VID10
Also this 'times up  no more ink…' is so lame and scripted. I haven't seen any tattoos get shutdown like halfway. it's a joke to try to convince us it's an actual competition., VID10
I just think calling people canvases is really lame. I know they ALWAYS do it  but it's really just highlighting that these people don't care about their clients. it's about the money - I'll doodle on you then leave my life forever., VID10
Why do you guys never show the finished tattoo what the hell is the point of watching all this if we can't see the end result lol?, VID10
the fox was gorgeous   i would have love to see the end result of the octopus also   seems really nice, VID10
who did the fox tattoo?, VID10
The admittance of being a narcissist was pretty funny, VID10
How can I see how the tattos turned out?!?!, VID10
Blond woman: tattooing and not talking to the canvas suddenly My mom died. She had lung cancer, VID10
Alexis makes me want to beat my dog I can't stand her crying every week. I'm so happy she's gone, VID10
Anybody else find Ash super annoying?, VID10
5:34 that skull is so ugly. The drawing is the easiest part. Wtf, VID10
Get drawin' LOL, VID10
The fox is hands down one of my favorites, VID10
The fox and that koi were good., VID10
They should at least show the critics of the judges ! I want to know what the judges say about the tattoos !, VID10
How can I watch full episodes?, VID10
Dave is killing it with that straight hair!!!, VID10
Left Arm | Howl, VID10
I think so bad this videos that have one frame for one or two seconds!, VID10
There all so pretty, VID10
TATTOOS ARE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS, VID10
Oh my oh my! The fox is so amazing! Damn! Freaking jealous man!, VID10
Ash is hott, VID10
Everybody Go Through Something Is All About Perseverance, VID10
The fox tattoo is stunning. Brilliant colours., VID10
I actually want a free handed tattoo., VID10
Where the heck can I watch this in Australia? Help anyone?, VID10
i think the real challenge would be using more dark skinned people to do tattoos on, VID10
PUT THIS ON NETFLIX OR HULU, VID10
Is it really freehand if they copy another pic, VID10
Those earrings are ridiculous. How the hell do they not get ripped out? You can see her when she moves her head  she's like a robot haha, VID10
Lol creepy Jason called my tattoos boring. I have all black and grey., VID10
who's the blonde, VID10
If you guys do a Season 13  can you please stop with the lame ass 'theme's?' ... In this case  man vs woman  I believe recently you had duos of two  and before that Team Peck vs Nunes... Oh yeah and there was Team Christian vs Team Cleen Rock One. And this season  season 12  not only do you have 'gender wars' you also have returning tattooers 'Coaching' Wow  great way to suggest the level of talent you have  as well as taking the limelight away from the contestants  no... to suggest they need coaches? The best seasons of Ink Master were the earlier ones where it was a group of individuals or two random teams... No coaching  no themes  no nothing. Just  A tattoo competition. Producers always have to ruin tv shows by getting too hands on. It's tiresome. Can we have one season that puts the spotlight solely on the artists ?! Is that too much to ask?, VID10
The skull and fox were breathtaking, VID10
1:47 god damn those are some big ass earrings, VID10
I really feel like Ash had a thing for Cam. Am I the only one?, VID10
Judges are on-the-nose douchebags, VID10
God finally. I feel so sorry for all those people ash tattoed. They should get a free tat removal, VID10
The fox is so gorgeously colored  the lines  the blending  and the flower branch accent just ties it all together! Really well done!, VID10
need Corey Hart to demo, VID10
Some of the best I've seen., VID10
Why always there needs to be satanist..., VID10
Love from indonesia..., VID10
Wolves and foxes r similar?? Ummmmmm no..... well they both have teeth and 4 legs and 2 ears lol, VID10
ash deserved to go home a while ago. her tattoos are mediocre and she has a terrible attitude., VID10
The Fox came out amazing, VID10
Fox is tha best  so gorgeous, VID10
I dont need your stories  I need to get your ass finished'. This guy is awesome, VID10
