p,"“She was also in the ICU and at first I thought she was a hard ass, but then realized she cares about all of her patients, love her! ”"
p,"First of all, I can't WAIT to see my bill!  :(
Second, my husband had a heart attack. Very very scary day for us!! They calmed us down SO much. The cardiac Dr, Dr Coven, cardiac surgeon, Dr Patel, and all the Staff, and I have to say, Rhonda and a VERY NY nurse, (CAN NOT REMEMBER HER NAME!! ) She was also in the ICU and at first I thought she was a hard ass, but then realized she cares about all of her patients, love her! 
Anyway, everyone, from the head Drs, to the nurses, to the Diabetic team, to the people, who serve the food (ugh sorry :)) and the mane who cleaned the room, were great!  I work in a restaurant and I TOTALLY APPRECIATE "" customer service"" even if it's in a hospital. 
Damn, I wish I knew Nurse Rachett's name (no offense, I LOVE HER!!) that was my first impression. My husband was sort of a pain. Lol
Can't say enough good things about this hospital. Been to others in Manhattan, but this is the best. 
(Like I said, can't wait for my bill.... Ugh.. Lol)"
p,I love the ER here. I had to go here twice due to bleeding emergencies as I'm anemic and have a weird liver issue but it was a great experience in the ER and later ICU. I have surgery here in a few days and am excited.
p,"I love This Hospital.
Both my children were born here when it was still a Private hospital.
I also came here in 1993 with a severe 3 day migraine headache that they treated.
And I was hospitalized in 2002 for 5 days when I had severe cellulites.
I had Excellent professional care and I felt safe and in capable hands by all staff.
They also have the best Nic U in  the country!
when my son was born 18 years ago there were complications and he had the best and upmost care at Lenox Hill.
I had a private room and I told my doctor I would not leave without my baby, no problem!
I stayed there for a week with my husband and was permitted in the ICU any time.
Lenix Hill gives excellent care all around.
I am a vegetarian and they were very good in any dietary needs for me.
when my second daughter was born residents wanted to come in during the birth and I said absolutely not!
I wanted to just have my doctor, nurse and my husband and they were very respecting my wishes.
I am a vegetarian and their food was excellent everything had nutrition and well balanced.
the hospital is very clean and the staff are very respectful.
This is the hospital I would recommend  to anyone needing any kind of medical care or giving birth."
n,"Our daughter was here for about three weeks and some of the time in ICU.
ICU is very quiet and professional but the regular rooms on the other side are a joke.
Very seldom cleaned right with medical trash under beds and on floor.  They never clean the restrooms and empty the trash when it needs it.
The BIGGEST problem is with the RN;s and the LPN's and the helpers in that they are on their phones all of the time and laughing and joking around and not doing their jobs when the patient needs help they pretty much blow them off.
It got so bad for us that we had my brother in law who is a general practice MD call the floor and ask them just 'what in the hell is going on up there'?.
Our daughter survived this ordeal by the grace of God and her wonderful Dr's but the nursing staff is in complete disarray at best.
Pathetic thing is that after I complained to the head of nursing 'she did NOTHING about it'.
Go figure."
p,"I refuse to go to any other hospital! The care provided by entire team here (ER, ICU, Step down, and Main Room) is STELLAR!! That's from the very kind housekeeper, the nursing assistant, nursing manager, RNs on day and night shift, and extremely competent and professional doctors. Thank you for making a scary experience relaxed! Thank you for caring about your patients and making sure we understand what's going on in our situation. I never felt like I wasn't informed. Also the physical therapy team was amazing!! You guys understand what patient care is all about! 

And they went ahead and scheduled my follow on appointment so it's one less thing I have to worry about!"
p,"My aunt ended up here. Even though the situation that found herself here was anything less then desirable (attempted suicide), the doctors did a good job trying to mend her.

Life Lesson: Always take care of yourself and your body.

Anyway, I worked for a number of years as a neurophysiologist clinician at UPMC while I was doing my M.S. in Neuroscience. I have developed an unusual knack for determining how thorough the doctors all.

The doctors at Lenox Hill were great. They did every test possible to make sure all their bases were covered and that the right treatment was provided. The attending physicians were also very nice and compassionate.

My aunt is still in the ICU and may not get out for a while. I do know that she will be in good hands when she is there. I would not hesitate to come here myself, although I would seek specialty treatment elsewhere. However, this hospital is good for basic services and according to the other reviews, ob/gyn.  Even though the hospital is a bit small, the doctors are at the top of their game."
p,"Went in for a minor issue. Absolutely no wait time. Place was extremely clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The medical staff were very professional and friendly as well, and I was out of there in very little time. Will definitely return when needed."
p,"This is the closest urgent care around my home. Since theyve opened i prefer going to them rather than the ER becos the wait is horrendous there. Here, u get seen quicker, no long wait, staff is always friendly and the drs are knowledgeable and very thorough. And the space is clean.

They also call u after a day or two to check up on u and see how ure feeling. My reg dr dont even do that ! Five stars!"
n,My husband called for he had a sprained ankle. The receptionist lady was very rude on the phone! My husband is french but his English is quite good! If it wasn't on the time emergency we would've definitely  looked elsewhere ! Being polite doesn't hurt!
n,"Absolutely the worst healthcare facility (if you can call it that) that I've been to.
The physician wasn't qualified to give to diagnose anything.  Steer clear of this place.  Wait for your pcp to be available, do not waste your money going to urgent care; especially this place.  These are not qualified professionals."
n,Dr Hillel is not a real Dr ! Be careful he does not know how to diagnose . And arrogant .
n,"Fever? Weakness? Body aches? Breathing problems? You most probably have the flu. I just saved you 2 hours of your life. These people will not give you antibiotics for those symptoms. No matter what you say. No z pack nothing. Just tea. 

After 2 hours of basically waiting around (30 min in the waiting room and 1.5h in the examination room) they will tell you to go home and drink liquids, sleep, don't leave the house till you're better no matter how long it takes, and oh yes wash your sheets and clothes several times. 
Oh yea and uh if anything changes or gets worse come to the office and wait around again for 2 hours. 

$225 gets you one appointment. And 2 follow ups. But who wants to go back and sit on that line. Better than the hospital, yes... But just as sucky if u end up waiting for hours. 

Doctors now are just not giving medicine for the flu anymore. They refuse to contribute to the crazy mutation of the flu virus. Every time a doctor or your friend gives you some antibiotics when you don't necessarily need it, these flu viruses learn how to get stronger and stronger, and are in effect less cureable the next time around, this is what happens in hospital settings, where people get reinfected over and over again by these viral infections and the medications no longer work. Anyway they don't give meds for the flu anymore. You will need to look elsewhere. 
3 stars bc it's a super clean and modern office, the receptionist is amazingly sweet, and I'm glad these places at least exist as an alternative to sitting in emergency rooms for those who are uninsured."
n,"There is no way I could recommend this facility to anyone.  I went there after 9 last night after being in a small motorcycle accident earlier that evening.  I will say the 3 girls at the front desk were sweet and friendly.  The facility was clean and I was immediately called into an examination room.  One of the girls at the front desk was also the x-ray technician and was very sweet and nice.  Everything else was a disgrace.  The aid, or nurse, I'm not sure exactly what her title was, was nice but had no knowledge of how to spell many common drugs or what they were prescribed for.  She did not seem to have much knowledge of medical terminology and when she went to dress a wound for me she was fumbling.  Instead of setting everything she needed neatly and within reach, she had to ask my boyfriend to give her the tape, while I held the bandage in place as she went to get the scissor.  But by far the most upsetting thing about this experience was the PA who was there, Benjamin Hillel.  He came into the examination room and immediately came off as arrogant, condescending and dismissive towards what I was telling him was my injury.  I'm sure a lot had to due with the fact that I'm a woman.  I came there with excruciating pain in the ball of my foot under my left big toe.  I told him I was sure I had a hairline fracture of one of my sesmoid bones.  He touched my toe for a quick second, moved it upward a tiny bit, which resulted in significant pain and then proceeded to tell me there was nothing wrong with my toe and he was more concerned with my left ankle.  Had he bothered to actually read over the history the woman had just typed in he would have seen that as a teenage I severed the joint between my left tibia/fibula and the upper bone of my heel, so I severed my foot under the ankle while the skin remained in tact and had a tendon transplant between the bones to reattach then to each other, thus the shape of my ankle.  Sent me for X-rays.  Technician immediately started taking films of my ankle (which I repeatedly told the PA wasn't injured) and then took some of my toes.  Now I am a grown woman.  I think I would know what part of my body was injured.  But no, this PA apparently knew where my pain was better than I did (dismissive, arrogant and condescending).  Take a step back and let me inform you that I am a physical therapist.  The films of my left toe did not show a clear fracture.  This is typical.  Unless the bone is actually separated the only real way to know it's fractured is through medical history which describes how the injury occurred, waiting at least a week or 2 to see if there is evidence of bone regenerating on the x-ray, which still may not be evident, a bone scan and finally an MRI which would be the most conclusive.  Mr. Hillel cane back to my room.  His demeanor was more relaxed and he told me nothing was wrong, didnt even probide me with a post-op boot that would stabilize my big toe so it wouldnt bend as i stepped and sent me on my way.  Despite my telling him repeatedly I couldn't put weight on my foot.  This morning I spent most of my day in the ER at Lenox Hill.  My toe, along with the front of my foot, at least 2 times the size it should be and a huge purple bruise right under where I feel the pain and you g up the inside of my toe.  Now I'm in a boot with crutches and non-weight bearing for probably the next 6 weeks.  I will NEVER step foot in this place again.  The medical care was a joke and the only reason I gave them 1 star is because you can't post a comment if you give no stars."
p,"I find this place to be extremely clean, kind and professional, they took care of my husband right away and the PA said he wanted to see him again on Sunday, my only problem here is that the follow up visit is just as much money as going the first time, they should give a discount or for free if they ask to see you again within a couple of days."
n,"I was unfortunate enough to have to visit the Quality First again. While the cleanliness of the facility hasn't changed since my original visit, the quality of care drastically did. 

The PA forgot to order a particular lab test we discussed during the consult. This resulted my PCP having to wait for the non-existent results for 2 days! These 2 days were spent in agony of pain and ignorance over my condition. 

Will I go back or recommend them? Take a guess!"
p,"What a great alternative to a traditional ER. Impressive. Visited the place for a minor but urgent problem. The center is truly state of the art and very, very clean. The reception staff was friendly and professional, fast and courteous. Then the RN did the system check-in and the NP ordered diagnostics. He never seemed rushed and responded to all questions. The longest part of the visit was getting the off-site radiologist to read the film; that took at most 15-20 mins. The entire visit was an hour or so, and that is with parking. Now I know, they offer valet in the garage off the side street. Super convenient!
The center has a boutique-style care and it is a very different vibe from any ER experience I've witnessed. 
It was extremely clean and I hope they will keep up the level of care and  spotless appearance."
p,I was just here to get some blood done for my other doctor and I was very happy that I didn't have to wait the staff was professional the doctors and nurses and the place was very clean I will recommend this place to most the people if they need to go for urgent care. It's very together
n,"I walked in asking only for a flu shot which is covered 100 % by Medicare. I had never been to an urgent care facility before so not knowing what the procedure is I filled out the stack of papers the receptionist gave me. It was medical history and HIPPA regulations, and probably a guarantor of the the account. Little did I expect that in a few weeks I would get a bill for an office visit copay. I questioned the billing office and was told this was considered an office visit and I was responsible for a copay. I only asked for a flu shot and they took my history and checked my vitals and considered that a visit which I never asked for or expected to have to pay for. As far as I am concerned this was Medicare Fraud by billing something to Medicare that they were not entitled to. As an example of the way this is supposed to happen is like a few weeks later I walked into a Walgreens Pharmacy to request a pneumonia shot. They did the right thing and took my insurance ID and gave me the shot I asked for."
p,Definitely would recommend this  place to anyone looking for urgent care.  Was there numerous times with my kids for different reasons. Never had to wait to long to be seen. Place is clean and neat. Doctors and nurses were always friendly and nice.  The do X-rays on the spot too. They even called me  for a follow up after few days to see how the kids were feeling. Overall great place
p,"The Dr and the assistant were nice and professional and the waiting time was not bad. I only give four stars bc of the receptionist. After seeing the dr I walked up to the front desk and asked the lady how much I need to pay for the visit. She responded by saying "" how much do you want to pay?"" What the heck? I just need to pay whatever I am supposed to . What kind of question is that ? Is that how you ( manager and owner) train your staff to talk the patients like that? That particular front desk needs to be trained PROPERLY."
n,"My father came here due to chest pain and high blood pressure, they took 225.00 just checked his pressure and send him home saying he is fine. Later that night he was admitted to the hospital.  Lack of experience and unqualified doctors."
p,"I like this place because it's convenient. I go in and they take me almost immediately. The only reason they lost some stars is because they could use more experienced staff. In my instance and in many others, they weren't necessarily too helpful during each visit. Also, when I tried to tell the nurse what I was feeling she stared at me and laughed. I do like the doctors there, they are kind and as helpful as they can be. 

But if you really feel like something is wrong then go to an actual physician after visiting this place for a second opinion. I've been sick for nearly 2 weeks now and they told me there's nothing wrong, to be fair they could've run a single test on me to try and figure out what was wrong but they didn't. 

Not a bad place at all, but it is what it is; urgent care. If there's something seriously wrong they could figure it out and then recommend you elsewhere. But if you need to go to the doctor, just visit your primary physician or a specialist."
n,"I woouldn't even give them one star.  They very much mislead me.  

I has a rip from my PCP for an x-ray.  I called first and asked them if they would do just the x-ray since I already has a scrip.  they said yes so I went over.  

When I was finished with papework they ushered me into an exam room.  I asked why and was told only they could write a scrip for their xrays and I needed an exam.  I told them it was a waste of time and $ but they insisted.

Exam!  Hah!  The PA did not even get a full set of vitals or a complete history.  She never even asked why my doc ordered the xray.  I think this was all a scam to bill my insurance & a big fraud.

When I called today to find out if my report was in she only asked my birthdate, not my name, not what kind of xray it was.  Then she asked for a fax number to send it to.  I hope I get my x-ray report.  Otherwise they are in total violation of HIPPA.

This is a VERY SLOPPY operation and very money grubby.  If you can't trust them on the money side how can you trust them with the medical side?"
p,Amazing place . I was out in 45 mins with all test done . Friendly doctor and staff and very clean . Definitely recommend it
n,"The front desk and nurses are very good and friendly while the dr that was there was the worst ive ever had.  I went in really not feeling well and having chronic sinusitus i knew what the problem was going in and more or less just needed a prescription and my pcp was unavaliable.  Dr harris told me i had vertigo cause i explained to.him i was dizzy cause my equilobrium was out of wack.  He wanted to send me for an xray a ct scan and wrote me a perscription for motion sickness and told me i need a vacation.  He also said i didnt have a fever and kept me waiting in the room for about 15mins while he ""spoke"" with his staff.  Dr harris was untrustworthy and didnt know anything..

Later that nite i was able to go to ny pcp with a 101.2 fever and a severe tonsill infection that puss was all over my tonsills..something dr harris didnt notice when he looked at my mouth.  

STAY AWAY FROM QUACK HARRIS.
its a shame cause the rest of the staff were great and the place has only been open a lil more than a week"
n,Took my daughter here after calling insurance company to find an urgent care place that they would pay for.  Showed up and was told they take my insurance but I must change my PCP first?  Wth?  I refused and ended up paying $225 out of pocket.  I also asked if all lab test would be covered.  They told me yes.  I just received a bill for $75 from a lab!!  This place is a scam!  Never again!  Disgusting
n,"This place is a joke... talk about ""urgent"" care. I waited to see a doctor for over 2 hours with what the receptionist told me was only 1 person before me! The nurse practitioner there was another joke on his own. It took him 10 minutes to log into their computer system there. I called the next day to speak to a managerial position there and the receptionist took my information and said I would get a call back within 10 minutes. Now I'm writing this review hours after and still no phone call. GO TO CITY MD, this place will have your patience level drop! Oh and the review about it being clean , the garbage by there water dispenser was overflowing!"
p,"Efram Zuller has treated me several times in the last few months. He is kind, compassionate and caring. He does all that he can to get you feeling better as quickly as possible.. I never wait more than 5 minutes to be seen. He has a great bedside manner and a great personality that puts your mind at ease knowing that he is willing to help you in any way he can.. Several of my friends have also started using him too. The rest of the staff is great too!"
p,"Yesterday I took my sick daughter here. The front desk staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient. They registered me right away, without making me fill out a lengthy form. Rather, they asked me the necessary questions and took my insurance card promptly. A nurse came within a few minutes to see us to the room, where she took my daughter's vitals. We then were seen by the medical director, Jacob Gerlitz, who thoroughly examined her. He was very professional; he listened to my concerns,  communicated well, and put me at ease. The whole process- registration, visit, and retrieving my car from valet parking (FREE, btw) took under 25 minutes. I would definitely return to this place.  In Brooklyn, valet parking for a clinic is rare and the service we received was outstanding."
